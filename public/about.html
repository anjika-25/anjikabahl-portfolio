<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! I’m Anjika Bahl, a passionate and curious learner currently in my first year 
  of B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Guru Nanak Institute of Technology, Kolkata.</p>

<p>From a young age, I’ve been someone who’s constantly drawn to creativity and innovation — 
  whether it's through sketching on a quiet afternoon, losing myself in music and dance, or diving into 
  the logical world of coding. Each of these interests brings a unique perspective to my life 
  and helps me grow both personally and professionally</p>

<p>My journey into the tech world started with a fascination for how things work behind the screen 
  — how simple lines of code can build something powerful and meaningful. As I continue my academic journey, '
  I'm excited to explore different areas of computer science, from web development and app design 
  to AI and machine learning.</p>

<p>While I’m still learning and evolving, one thing remains clear — I’m determined to make the most of 
  every opportunity, push my limits, and ultimately become successful in my field. I believe in balancing creativity
   with logic, passion with discipline, and dreams with action. I’m always open to collaboration, learning from 
   others, and sharing ideas. Whether it’s a group project, a coding challenge, or just a good conversation 
   — I’m here for it!</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by my portfolio, and I hope we get a chance to connect!</p>
